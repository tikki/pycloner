cloner is a simple python script that clones a part of the file system

it's somewhat like a slow (and possibly unreliable) version of rsync -a
only that it uses python, which is very handy if you're on a platform that
doesn't have a good rsync port (e.g. windows - cygwin DOES NOT always
properly handle unicode paths).

it has been tested on Windows 7 x64 and seems to work there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

usage:
	cloner.py src_path dst_path
	
it can also easily be imported and used as part of another script

there are currently 3 methods of file comparison:
	- by size and date only
	- by hashed file content
	- by file content
	
the first two methods use caching
the last method shouldn't be used in most scenarios

there is also a hybrid comparison method which uses size & date and falls back
to using the hash method in case the files don't match. this is now the default.
ATTENTION! this hybrid method also tries to fix the date (and other stats) of
a file if the files match by hash(content) and it WON'T ask first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

todo:
	- add command line options so it becomes a proper tool
	- fix bugs
		- (none known..?)
	- put in more features
		- more sophisticated methods of comparison
		- a persistent database

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this current version is neither feature complete nor bug free, so use only
with utter care.
